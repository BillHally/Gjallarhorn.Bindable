A Brief Introduction to Gjallarhorn.Bindable
========================

Gjallarhorn.Bindable provides a new UI architecture for XAML platforms

The goal is to keep the best of XAML (decoupled view, flexible UI, high performance rendering, etc), 
while allowing a fully immutable data model, pure functions for updates on the model, and a clean 
architecture to be used for representing the application.

This is done by building up on the Gjallarhorn project to create a reactive, data flow oriented 
framework for XAML Binding.
